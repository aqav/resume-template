\section{Work Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{JetBrains Research}, Remote}{01/2020 -- 12/2020}
\role{HoTT and Dependent Types}{Arend Team Intern}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.25ex]
\item Used features like gradle composite build and buildSrc to reduce build time and improve automation.
\item Improved the language/IDE, such as sections, hygiene macros, optimized \texttt{Fin} type, semantic highlighting, etc.
\item Created an extensible REPL framework, provided implementations in CLI (with contextual completion) and in IntelliJ IDEA (interacts with the opened project, supports completion, highlighting and goto definition).
\item Designed and implemented an expression type-checking debugger that supports step-into and displays local context and expressions as stack frames.
\end{itemize}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{PLCT Lab}, Remote}{12/2020 -- Present}
\role{Implementation of Dependent Types}{Types team lead}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.25ex]
\item Leading the types team to explore modern techniques in dependent type implementation, such as pattern unification of implicit variables, type checking of pattern matching, termination check of recursive definitions, etc.
\end{itemize}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{PingCAP Inc.}, Remote}{08/2018 -- 08/2019}
\role{Distributed Storage Systems}{TiKV Intern - Ecosystem Team}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.25ex]
\item Improved many TiKV-relevant libraries, like optimizing the performance of \href{https://docs.rs/crate/grpcio} {grpcio}, adding new features to \href{https://docs.rs/crate/procinfo} {procinfo}.
\item Helped to migrate the Protocol-Buffer library used by TiKV and its Raft implementation.
\item Learned a lot about Rust programming, distributed system, working remotely, and databases.
\end{itemize}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Sourcebrella Inc. (now Ant Financial Code Insight)}, Shenzhen, China}{02/2018 -- 07/2018}
\role{Static Analysis}{Developer Intern}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.25ex]
\item Created IntelliJ/CLion/Eclipse plugin for the Pinpoint analyzer. Co-worked on the SonarQube plugin.
